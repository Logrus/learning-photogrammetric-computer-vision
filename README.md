# \[Classical\] Image stitching from scratch

## About project

This project is for *educational* purposes, it contains implementation of image stitching using classical keypoint detection and description calculation.

The goal of this project is to serve a quick guide of refresher on how classical visual feature detector pipelines work.

The project covers:

- Harris and Shi-Thomasi corner detectors
- Simplified SIFT-inspired descriptor
- Homography computation

This project is based on online course [Photogrammatric Computer Vision](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/online-training-pcv/index.html) by Prof. Cyrill Stachniss and I would like to express my sincere appreciation for providing great learning materials for free, online, for everyone to learn.

Here I have a more detailed re-work of the material which I did for myself, but please check the original [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGTPQhKBOGgjTgX-mzpsOGOX) first.
